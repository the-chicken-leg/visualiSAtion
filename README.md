# How to visualize

Each subfolder is the name of a data structure or algorithm and contains a main.py file which you can run to watch the magic - run the main.py file from the project root folder so that the PYTHONPATH is correct.

The main.py file includes "tuneables" so grandma can have fun too - or you can just jump right into the algo itself.
